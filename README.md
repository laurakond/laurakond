## About me
Hi, I am Laura Kondrataite, a Full Stack Software Developer. I am currently transitioning into the world of tech, actively seeking my first role within the industry.

Iâ€™m currently working on improving my React skills and learn more about databases.


ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with landing my first job within tech industry. Let's chat! 

When I'm not coding, I channel my creativity by cross-stitching artworks. My current project is a painting by an impressionist artist Edgar Degas. I also enjoy a good walk whether it's to unwind or secretly think of solutions for tackling those pesky coding errors!
