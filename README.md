<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Laura</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am Junior Full Stack Web Developer</h3>

## About me

🛅 I am working as a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer for a Market Data financial firm.

🔭 I’m actively working on improving various skills through practice and experimenting at work, including learning PHP and Laravel framework, Vue.js fundamentals, Tailwind CSS, Quasar, Cypress and unit testing to name a few!

🤔 I’m looking to expand my knowledge and build a strong skill set so I can become an expert in the field.

🤼 I am looking to work and collaborate on creative and exciting projects with anyone who'd like to join in. Let's chat!

🎨 When I'm not coding, I channel my creativity by recreating artworks with a needle and thread. My current project is a painting by an impressionist artist, Edgar Degas. I also enjoy a good walk, a game of tennis and a turn around the dance floor busting my Lindy hop moves. All of these activities allow me to unwind or secretly think of solutions for tackling those pesky coding errors!
