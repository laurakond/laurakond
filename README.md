<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Laura</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am Junior Full Stack Software Developer</h3>

## About me
üõÖ I am currently transitioning into the world of tech, actively seeking my first role within the industry.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on improving my React skills and learn more about databases.


ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with landing my first job within tech industry. Let's chat! 

When I'm not coding, I channel my creativity by cross-stitching artworks. My current project is a painting by an impressionist artist Edgar Degas. I also enjoy a good walk whether it's to unwind or secretly think of solutions for tackling those pesky coding errors!
